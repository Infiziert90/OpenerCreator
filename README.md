Opener Creator is a Dalamud plugin that lets you create or import openers and analyze your in-game actions against them.

Default openers were taken from [The Balance](https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/) and [Fey's Temperance](https://www.feys-temperance.gg/).

> ⚠️ **This plugin is at an early stage. Bugs are to be expected.**
